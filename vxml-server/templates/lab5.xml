      <!-- HOW TO USE THIS DEMO:
      This is a quiz-based demo in which various random funny facts are presented for the user to guess 
      and have some fun while doing something else: can be walking to the store, or while in the toilet!
      The main menu allows the user to pic among two topics: animal facts or human facts. 
      Alternatively, the user can also choose to exit the demo in the menu.
      When an option is chosen, the program directs the user to that specific form 
      and start prompting the different questions (and their answers at the end).
      After the topic form is completed, it directes the user back to the main menu 
      to choose either the remaining topic or exit the demo. In the last case, the user is directed 
      to the exit form in which the system will confirm
      again if they want to exit or no.
